                    In a word (or two), I'm deeply curious. I think it's that sense of curiosity that started
                    my journey into computer science, actually. How things work, and why they work the
                    way they do are questions that I find myself asking about almost everything. And,
                    since starting my journey, a new question has arisen: <em> How can we make it better? </em>

                If you're reading this, it's highly likely that you've already taken a look at my
                resume, but I'll informally highlight a few key points to understand more about my
                background for a quick overview. I'm a <div class = highlight> current junior </div> (graduating 2025) <div class = highlight>
                majoring in Computer Science </div> at <div class = highlight>Boston
                College </div>. My most recent semester GPA was a 3.9, and I'm looking forward to rounding that
                number out (in the upwards direction) this coming fall. I'm a <div class = highlight> paid TA </div> for an introductory
                python course at BC , and my responsibilities include instructing a discussion section,
                holding office hours, and grading assignments. I am the <div class = highlight> Tech Lead of the Boston College
                Computer Science Society </div>, and work with my team to host the yearly hackathon and other tech-related events.

                In my freetime, I'm a very creative- and perhaps slightly eccentric- person. Ask me about my
                woodworking, butterfly collection, and snail shell painting. At school, I find creative oulets like the Makerspace <!- - link here later - -> and in writing
                for magazines like Stylus<!- - link here later - ->. One of my favorite parts of attending a liberal arts college
                is the exposure I have to a variety of diverse fields. I truly love to learn, and take full advantage
                of the vast expertise at BC.
